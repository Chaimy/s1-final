- Setup

Do bundle install in your directory. 

This library has been tested with Ruby 1.9.2, but I think it should work with MRI 1.8.7 with no changes. 

- Usage

table = Bricks::Table.new(array_of_arrays) # will load all the data into the table.

You'll be able to access the table by rows doing:

table.rows

Or by columns doing: 

table.columns

-- Column names

You can set column names when creating the table like this:

table = Bricks::Table.new(array_of_arrays, :header => %w(id name email) )

Or specify to obtain the header from the first row:

table = Bricks::Table.new(array_of_arrays, :first_row_as_header => true)

-- Accessing one specific row

table.rows[0]

-- Accessing one specific column by index

table.columns[0]

-- Accessing one specific column by name

Provided that you have specified column names before (in the constructor) you can do this:

table.columns['name']

- Accomplishments 

I've accomplished several things:

* Interact with Enumerable in a cleanly way. 

* To use DelegateClass, to avoid inheriting from standard classes, like Array or Hash. 

* To really think about problems. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to accomplish this thing in a ruby-way, writing clean, maintainable and easy to read code. 

* The value of testing. 

* Finally, coding style. Use vertical spaces. Lots. To do not indent private or public.
